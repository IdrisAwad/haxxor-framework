# haxxor-frramework
Fuzzing, Scanning, Privilege Escalation, and Post-Exploitation framework. Written 100% in Python 2.7
## How to use haxxor-framework
First, make sure you are running as root (Mac/Linux)
For Ubuntu it would be:
  *sudo python #downloadpath/setup.py*
  sudo haxxor
  and if you want to uninstall
  sudo python uninstall.py
  This moves the directories back to the haxxor-framework directory for easy reinstallation.
Mac (same as Ubuntu)
Kali Linux (or any distro running out of box root)
  python #downloadpath/setup.py
  haxxor
  and if you want to uninstall
  python uninstall.py
  This moves the directories back to the haxxor-framework directory for easy reinstallation.
# How does it work
It integrates some prewritten tools (credit is given) and some written by me (aka sitecloner)

 Mac/Windows/Linux
