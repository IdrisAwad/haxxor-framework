# haxxor-frramework
Simple fuzzing and scanning tool with a few tricks up its' sleeve ;).
## How to use haxxor-framework
First, make sure you are running as root (Mac/Linux)
For Ubuntu it would be:
  sudo python #downloadpath/setup.py
  sudo haxxor
Mac (same as Ubuntu)
Kali Linux (or any distro running out of box root)
  python #downloadpath/setup.py
  haxxor
# How does it work
It is a sorta based off of some things I immitated from multiple other tools (metasploit and veil)
# Why should you use it?
A special module will launched along with haxxor-framework called firefuzz. It is basically a fuzzer for Firefox on Mac/Windows/Linux
# Windows Version?
That will come later on with, hopefully, help from the community
# Progress
Right now, haxxor-framework is just, well, a framework with no modules.
Hopefully as a community we can make this tool great
# Donations and other stuff
this tool is free, but donations (not right now, for when we get a functioning tool) are helpful and they will most likely go towards hiring help to make the tool greater
the tool is also open source so send those merge request in for dis boi here
it would help me a lot if you send in bugs to get the bugs fixed quicker
